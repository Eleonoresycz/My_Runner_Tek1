# My_Runner_Tek1
Epitech project

First Graphical project created with CSFML library after 3 months of C. The code does not reflect my current level.
The goal: In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of a finite Endless Running Game.

I think C++ with SFML is better than C with SFML. I have understood why video games are create with C++ in my second year at Epitech.

To execute the project you have to be in root floder in your shell.
First command: make
